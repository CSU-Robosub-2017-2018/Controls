Robosub: Controls 2017-2018, (Add years changed here)
===========================
Last Updated: April 27, 2018

CSU Robosub team is a senior desgin team with the goal of creating an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The vehicle is made to compete in the [nationonal robosub competition](http://www.robonation.org/competition/robosub) hosted by the navy in [California](http://scripts.mit.edu/~orca/wiki/index.php?title=Transdec).

The [2017-2018 team](http://csuauv.colostate.edu/2017-2018/) is "vertically integrated" meaning that it is made up of 11 seniors as well as 4 underclassman and 2 gradutate advisors. The team is split up into 4 different subteams: Propulsion, Sensors, Mechanical, and Controls.

## Controls ##
The controls subteams goal is to integrate sensors and propulsion systems to make the AVU autonomous. 
We worked really hard in the 2017-2018 academic year to provide a robust variety of libraries specifially tailored to the robosub. They include:
* Computer Controller Motor Drivers
* PID Controller
* Xbox Controller Support
* Integration with Sensors.

### Motor Driver ###
This driver is the interface between running vision and stabilization on the Raspberry pi and Controlling the Electronic speed controllers(ESC) of the Propulsion subteams Motors.

Originally the decision was made to try and run all of the motor ESCs off of a PWM singal generated by an Arduino. All of our code was to be run off of a Raspberry Pi then sent to the Arduino.

A Considerable amount of time was spent trying to create a reliable interface between the Raspbewrry Pi and Arduino. Several methods of doing this were considered including SPI, I2C, and UART. Eventually it was decided to use serial because it only needed the USB cable to operate. This effort was abandon because a information was never able to be reliablly communicated between over serial. The communication would be consistant one run then not exsistant another.

We switched over to using and [Adafruit 12bit PWM hat](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2327) to control the ESCs. This solution is considerallby more reliable than the Arduino. It was exremely easy to get working as well. Only taking about 2 days of work to get the solution relablly outputting the values that we needed.
