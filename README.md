Robosub: Controls 2017-2018, (Add years changed here)
===========================

CSU Robosub team is a senior desgin team with the goal of creating an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The vehicle is made to compete in the [nationonal robosub competition](http://www.robonation.org/competition/robosub) hosted by the navy in [California](http://scripts.mit.edu/~orca/wiki/index.php?title=Transdec).

The [2017-2018 team](http://csuauv.colostate.edu/2017-2018/) is "vertically integrated" meaning that it is made up of 11 seniors as well as 4 underclassman and 2 gradutate advisors. The team is split up into 4 different subteams: Propulsion, Sensors, Mechanical, and Controls.

## Controls ##
The controls subteams goal is to integrate sensors and propulsion systems to make the AVU autonomous. We worked really hard the 2017-2018 academic year to provide a robust variety of libraries specifially tailored to the robosub. They include:
* Computer Controller Motor Drivers
* PID Controller
* Xbox Controller Support
* Integration with Sensors.
